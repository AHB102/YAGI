Features of YAGI 

Network Information: YAGI can provide comprehensive network information, such as IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, DNS servers, MAC addresses, and network interface details. This information can be used to troubleshoot network problems, identify security vulnerabilities, and plan network changes.
Ping and Traceroute: YAGI can be used to perform ping and traceroute, which are two essential tools for diagnosing network connectivity issues. Ping can be used to verify that a particular host is reachable, while traceroute can be used to identify the route that packets take to reach a particular host.
Port Scanning: YAGI can be used to scan for open ports on a remote host. This information can be used to identify potential security vulnerabilities, such as hosts that are running services that are not needed.
Bandwidth Testing: YAGI can be used to test the network's bandwidth. This information can be used to monitor network performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
Network Configuration Backup: YAGI can be used to backup and restore network device configurations. This is important for ensuring that network configurations can be easily restored in case of failures.
DHCP Management: YAGI can be used to release, renew, and flush DHCP leases. This is important for troubleshooting DHCP-related issues.
Network Topology Visualization: YAGI can be used to visualize the network topology. This can be helpful for understanding the network layout and identifying potential points of failure.
Interface Configuration: YAGI can be used to configure network interfaces. This includes setting IP addresses, subnet masks, and enabling/disabling interfaces.
DNS Management: YAGI can be used to query DNS records, flush DNS cache, and configure DNS settings. This is important for ensuring that DNS queries are resolved correctly.
Network Traffic Analysis: YAGI can be used to analyze network traffic, monitor bandwidth usage, and identify potential security threats. This information can be used to improve network security and performance.
